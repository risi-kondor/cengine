\begin{cldescr}{\ccode{Coperator}}

\ccode{Coperator} is the virtual base class of all operator objects that the \ccode{Cengine} can 
accept in its \ccode{push} method. 
New operators are defined simply by subclassing \ccode{Coperator}. 



\begin{clgroup}[Member variables]
\member{Cnode* owner}{Pointer to the compute graph node associated with this operation.}
\member{vector<Cnode*> inputs}{Vector of pointes to the compute graph nodes corresponding to the inputs 
of this operation.}
\end{clgroup}

\begin{clgroup}[Methods]
\member{virtual void exec()=0}{
The \ccode{exec} member function carries out the actual operation. 
This function is run by one of the CPU worker threads after all the inputs of the operator 
have already been computed. Therefore the body of the function can assume 
\ccode{inputs[0]->obj,...,inputs[k]->obj} point to all the correct input objects.  
}
\\
\member{virtual string str() const=0}{
Return a human readable representation of the operator for debugging purposes. 
}
\end{clgroup}
