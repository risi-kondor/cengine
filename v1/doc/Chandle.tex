\begin{cldescr}{\ccode{Chandle}}

\ccode{Chandle} objects are used in user code to refer to objects managed by the engine. 
In particular, most \ccode{push} commands return a \ccode{Chandle} to the object created, and, in turn, 
command arguments are passed to the engine in the form of \ccode{Chandle}s. 

\ccode{Chandle}s are also critical for the engine's memory management. As long as there is 
at least one \ccode{Chandle} pointing to a given backend object, the object is not deleted. 
On the other hand, when the last \ccode{Chandle} referencing a given object is deleted and 
there are no operations enqued in the engine dependging on the object as an argument either, 
the object is automatically scheduled for deletion.
